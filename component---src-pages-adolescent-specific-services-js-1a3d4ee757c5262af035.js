Counselling is a process which provides safe environment to explore and express oneself and enable them to change and flourish despite the difficulties they face by adapting healthy coping styles. Adolescent Counselling is similar to Adult Counselling but uses developmental psychology approaches.\\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO), at least 20 percent of young people are likely to experience some form of mental illness such as depression, Mood disturbances, Substance abuse, Suicidal behaviours, Eating disorders and others.\\nAdolescents today face multiple challenges as well as distractions. They are flooded with all kinds of pressures right from exams and deadlines to lure of internet or relationships. If left on their own they may suffer from low self-esteem, Adolescent Counselling helps them successfully navigate through these tough times."},{"id":"2","label":"What are the Challenges of Adolescent Age?","transitionComponent":"None","headingTag":"","description":"Adolescence is the period of transition between childhood and adulthood. Stress, obesity and better nutrition are thought to be shifting puberty age earlier than before. It is also now a known fact that brain development continues into early 20s. These years are the years of self-discovery and forming identity. Some teens become perplexed as they have to make some difficult choices about academics, friends, gender identity etc.\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Peer Pressure:</strong> Desire to fit in and form friendships is important for any adolescent. Peer influence is reflected from clothes they wear to music they listen. Influence can be positive also if they have friends who are good at sports/other skills or academics. In this age often family takes a backseat and friends, appearance, romantic interest become very important. Teens often indulge in high risk behaviours such as experimenting with alcohol and drugs, rash driving, sex as they are not able to handle this pressure. A <a href=\'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721412471347\' target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color:#f7941e\\">2013 study</a> reveals that teens are more likely to engage in risky activities in presence of their peers compared to when they are alone. A youngster who is not in a relationship is seen as naïve or nerd. Break ups and insecure relationship is often leading cause of depression and Suicidal tendency.\\n<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Body Image: </strong>Body image is how we think, feel or behave with regard to our physical appearance. Adolescence represents a crucial stage in the development of positive or negative body image <a href=\'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042816313933\' target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color:#f7941e\\">(Croll, 2005)</a>. Indian obsession with fair skin is widely known. An estimated 60 percent of Indian women and 10 percent of men use fairness products. Media (TV, magazines, newspapers and now social media) is a very powerful tool, it is used to portray how an ideal body must be or should be. Girls’ fascination towards zero figure can be a good example of the hype. Body image issues no longer exclusively affect young ladies, males also are now increasingly getting affected. Teens often resort to extreme measures by eating unhealthy, doing excessive exercise and even use drugs/surgery to maintain body shape/size. Teens negatively evaluate themselves and be at risk for body shaming, body image disturbance, eating disorders and depression. <a href=\'https://books.apa.org/education/ce/sexual-objectification\' target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color:#f7941e\\">(Fredrickson, Roberts, 1997)</a>\\n<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Distractions: </strong>Life of a teen is intertwined with technology. Teenagers have a strong need to connect socially and social media is their way of connecting with friends. 90% of teens use social media to have fun, stay connected, meet new friends, express and explore themselves and share their artwork or music. Most of the teenagers have easy access to phone and internet which also makes them vulnerable to harmful and inappropriate content like porn, drugs, violence as well as danger of cyberbullying. Excess screen time is a common concern for parents as it affects the sleep, activity level and academic decline.\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Bullying:</strong> Bullying is a purposeful torture which can be physical, verbal or psychological. It is very different from playful teasing. Bullying is any behaviour involving hitting, pushing, threatening, extorting money/valuables to excluding the child by spreading rumours or hurtful use of social Media. Bullying can leave deep emotional scars and shake the confidence of the child. Bullying can make simple experience like going to school a nightmare. Be careful if notice your child refuses to go to school or go by bus, is more moody or anxious, not eating/sleeping well or doing things liked usually. It is important to talk about it. Counselling can help a lot in this situation.\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Fake World:</strong> Teenagers highly value being popular and having social acceptance. Teenagers use social media (Instagram/FB/Snapchat/Tiktok) to seek approval or fake likes and post their photoshopped pictures/selfies and/or share their videos. Social media is a platform to show off how happy and ‘perfect’ your life is. <a href=\'https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel\' target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color:#f7941e\\">Studies </a>have shown that this competitive and fake ‘like’ culture of social media leads to low self-esteem. Teens who feel unloved and neglected often get involved in an unhealthy relationship which can seriously affect the mental health of your teen.\\n<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Real Life v/s Reel Life:</strong> Teens today live more in a virtual world rather than real world. Virtual worlds allow players to explore, interact and play in digital landscapes and choose any avatar which is your online persona. (for instance, Runescape/World of Warcraft)\\n<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Doesn’t Want to Listen: </strong>Do you often worry why your teen doesn’t listen to you or ignores home rules? Do you feel this rebel streak in your teen pushes your buttons? Arguing, experimentation, defying home rules, driving fast all these typical teenage behaviours. All teenagers go through a phase in life where need for independence, an identity separate from parents and testing authority becomes crucial. Parents often blame themselves and are very concerned about this behaviour. Good news is that it is Normal! A part of growing up! Disconnected Families: In this fast-paced life, parents have lost the connect with their children. While spending time with children, parents constantly keep checking phones for mails or message or picking up calls which make a child feel that they are not as important as the other on phone."},{"id":"3","label":"Why we need to Understand Teens’/ Adolescents’ Behaviour?","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Careful-Brain under Construction: </strong>During teen years, area of brain called Prefrontal cortex, your “judgement centre &amp; thinking cap” is under construction. This developing area is often linked to the typical teen behaviours. The arguments the teens do in this age is typically their own way to practice their analytical skills on their parents. According to David Elkind, Author of All Grown Up and No Place to Go, teenagers are now able to develop their own ideas and ideals. Those kids who saw their parents as their role models now find their parents far away from ideal. They often feel embarrassed that their parents don’t know how to walk, talk or dress-up. They now base their own idea of ideal parents on either their friend’s parent whom they find cool or on media’s portrayal of parents.\\n<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Peculiarities of the Age: </strong>In teenage, immediate rewards of a choice appeal more than the possible risks leading to enhanced risk-taking behaviours. Pre frontal cortex-a part of brain responsible for decision making is also not fully developed leading to poor impulse control and difficulty in handling pressure from others.\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Wants to Explore World in Own Way: </strong>Teens often see parents as their enemy and are not able to differentiate who are the real well-wishers. Although parents love their teens and have their best interests in mind but a teen is unable to adopt viewpoint of parents or others as brain is still budding. They start forming their own opinions and want to have freedom which often is not allowed by parents. Need is to understand the limitations of teen brain and their desire to have individual identity, own idea or opinions as an important developmental phase of teen. Giving freedom with responsibility is the best choice for a parent.\\n<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Immense Energy: </strong>Channelizing the immense potential of the teenagers is essential for them to blossom into responsible adults. Teenage years are the most vibrant yet vulnerable years in a teenagers’ life. Weeding out negative habits and identifying strengths, interests to engage them in activities of their choice would help them nurture their talent and make this youth power an asset to the Nation.\\n<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Lack of Ambition: </strong>One of the biggest concerns for a parent today is that their teens has no ambition or motivation. Lack of ambition can be either as teen doesn’t care or is lazy or is unfocused. Setting small goals can be a good way to set them for a happy and fulfilled life. Career Counselling also helps to clear their confusion related to selecting stream, college or courses along with help in academic concerns and finding best fit careers.\\nUnfortunately, in today’s time, parents are busy either with their work or with gadgets and the basic needs of the adolescent are not met and when at home they don’t truly feel being “at home”. All teens need care, appreciation, security, structured home environment and sense of belonging like any other human being. This need is often fulfilled in their friend circles, so many teens give up on their parents and completely drift towards their friends who understand them better. We often miss out children who are quite and obedient, some teens escape from normal life which they might be finding difficult into comfort of online fantasy world. The kids who are already struggling with mental health issues like anxiety, depression etc are typically vulnerable. It is highly recommended that the parents familiarize themselves with the technology used by their teens and set limits about screen time and install privacy setting on gadgets.\\nEvery hour there is one teen suicide in India. That alone is a shocking fact, but also every one out of five teens suffer from depression or anxiety. The pressures young people undergo during this transition from child to adult make them vulnerable to mental health issues and hence the need for counselling adolescents."},{"id":"4","label":"Certain Events that may Impact Adolescents’ Mental Health","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"Sibling birth&^&Death of a loved one&^&Insecure relationships&^&Physical/sexual abuse&^&Poverty/natural disaster&^&Domestic violence&^&Parental divorce or separation&^&Moving to a new place /attending a new school&^&Unrealistic parental expectations&^&Academic pressure"},{"id":"5","label":"How to Know that Teen Needs Help?","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"If you are a teenager and feel sad most of the time and this is affecting youracademics or relationships with friends or family, or feel that you are not beingyourself, or if you feel too stressed, you need to really talk to someone.\\nYou as parent should watch for the typical signs in your teenager:\\nDifficulty in coping with daily life&^&Excessive worrying&^&Extended period of feeling low&^&Low energy&^&Change in eating habits&^&Disturbance in sleep&^&Suicidal thoughts or self-harm&^&Explosive mood&^&Drug/alcohol abuse&^&Aggression behaviour"},{"id":"6","label":"What Role Parents Should Play for Healthy Adolescent Development?","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"Adolescence is often referred as a period of storm or stress.
