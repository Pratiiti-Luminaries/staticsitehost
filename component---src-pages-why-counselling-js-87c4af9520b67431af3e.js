Often we are able to easily manage these situations but we all go through times when we feel alone and no one seems to understand or knows how to help. Counselling can help.\\nCounselling helps individuals overcome challenges and develop resilience for the future. Counselling not only prevents mental issues but also guides students in making the right career choices at the right time. It helps the individual become aware of their strengths and weaknesses and enables them to leverage their strengths optimally.\\nCounselling helps students identify what they are really passionate about and guides them in achieving their goal. For students who are plagued with low self-confidence, negative attitude and ineffective decision-making capability, the need for career counselling becomes all the more important.\\nAccording to Dr Dhaarna, <strong>“The guidance given to young minds sets them off on a well-defined path leading to a meaningful life and reinforces the workforce of the nation.”</strong>\\nWhile giving reference to her experience at prestigious residential schools, Dr Dhaarna said <strong>“Counselling is very essential for teenagers as it prevents them from developing suicidal tendencies or mental illnesses or become a victim of substance abuse, etc.”</strong> In addition to prevention of mental illness, counselling provides the proactive measures to facilitate the individuals who are vulnerable to get stuck in a downward spiral.\\nIncreasing cases of marital discord in the society due to the assertion of independence, diminishing capacity for adjustment and ego clashes are also hugely benefitted by counselling. Dr Dhaarna’s open and accessible disposition makes the individual comfortable and provides the environment conducive enough to share their concerns freely and frankly."}]')},HoIJ:function(e,n,o){"use strict";o.r(n);var t=o("q1tI"),i=o.n(t),a=o("tRbT"),s=o("yGfC"),r=o("Bl7J"),l=o("tcyQ"),d=o("vrFN"),u=o("jOeb"),h=o("A7oL");n.default=function(){return i.a.createElement(r.a,null,i.a.createElement(d.a,{title:"Know Why Counselling is important for Career, Marriage, Adolescent etc ?",description:"Know Why Counselling is important for Career, Marriage, Adolescent etc ?
