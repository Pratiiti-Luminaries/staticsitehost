The foundation for the personality, attitude, intellect and social development is laid during these formative years. Children spend one third of entire childhood years in school itself. The sculpting of the child’s mind becomes the responsibility of the school so that child blossoms holistically. Though the schools have enough activities all the year round there is a strong need to rope in psychological wellness initiatives to maximize overall well-being of the students.  Inculcating the life skills, academic skills and socio-emotional skills in the school itself would ensure a generation of healthy, strong and happy children who are the assets to the society!\\nChildren learn best when learning is filled with fun and activity.
