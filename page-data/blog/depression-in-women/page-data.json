Often women also have to deal with interference or frequent conflicts with in-laws. Some may also have troubled marriage, or alcoholic partner and an emotionally unavailable partner who neither shares any household workload or play any role in parenting leaving the wife completely stressed out. All these social circumstances and stressors additionally make the women susceptible to higher rates of depression.</p>\n<p>There are different stages of life when a female becomes more vulnerable to depression. They are:-</p>\n<p><strong>Adolescence</strong>– Often during the adolescence, mood swings due to hormonal surge are quite common. Girls who experience significant stress due to Identity Issues, body image, disturbed home environment or increased academic pressure may be at increasing risk of depression.</p>\n<p><strong>Premenstrual Period</strong>- Some females may experience severe Premenstrual Syndrome (bloating, abdominal cramps, irritability, anxiety, tender breasts) leading to Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder which may include feeling suicidal and often significantly impair the life.</p>\n<p><strong>Pregnancy and Post Delivery</strong>- Often depression is seen in women during pregnancy or after giving birth to the baby due to major hormonal fluctuations that influence mood. It may affect those more who already had some mood or anxiety issues. Increased stress due to lack of sleep, feeling inability to take responsibility of baby, feeding issues, changes in body shape may lead to depression in around 11% of women during this period.</p>\n<p><strong>Perimenopause and Menopause</strong>- Risk of depression may increase during menopause as the hormone levels fluctuate erratically. This may affect any woman especially when menopause happened early in life or after surgical removal of ovary/uterus. Highly stressful life, empty nest syndrome, sexual difficulty because of menopause, weight issues, sleep disturbances, history of anxiety/depression also are factors which contribute to depression.</p>\n<p><strong>Beating Depression</strong></p>\n<p>Psychotherapy is a powerful treatment approach.
