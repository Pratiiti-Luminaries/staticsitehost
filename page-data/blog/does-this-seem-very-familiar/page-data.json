You refuse that your child can not have the toy and instead of obeying you, the boy started to cry, scream, and hit you and then roll on the floor in front of everyone in a full blown tantrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t feel Guilty, Would you like to know why this happens?</strong></p>\n<p>Toddlers get frustrated very easily.
