She is a working professional and had a love marriage with her college friend after five years of courtship. Her world turned upside down when she caught him red-handed while her husband was on video call with the other woman in another room of her flat. He confessed that he had recently started this online affair and promised to cut off all ties she was in a state of shock and disbelief. She has been in therapy after she found her husband cheating.</p>\n<p>At times our expectations that the spouse should provide everything for us, be it love, sex, social or emotional security, loyalty and also the belief that we deserve all of this <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/signs-of-cheating\">causes some people to cheat</a>.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Shah confided during counselling session that she had started feeling that her relationship with her husband had become dry and he was very indifferent towards her. She belonged to a very affluent business family. Her husband was too busy expanding business and would spend hours in business related work even when together.

No Man is an Island. We prefer to be with others and shrivel if we feel isolated and thrive when feel well connected with others. Feeling isolated may induce depressive symptoms which overrun over nervous system. In lockdown specially, as there is a restricted movement, couples expect a lot from each other.</p>\n<p>Positive communication with partner and expressing what one is feeling helps having strong bond.</p>\n<p>Changes are inevitable but how one deals with these changes and work through them makes or breaks the relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>How can you seek help?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for changing phone habits– Technology is a big giveaway. If you see some new apps meant for secure communication be watchful. If partner is too protective of their phones beware!</li>\n<li>A Sudden Makeover– Sudden focus on being fit, too much investment on appearance, clothing hairstyle may be a red flag when partner has been otherwise too causal in approach.</li>\n<li>Changes in Intimacy– Sudden shift in libido and sexual frequency needs to be watched. Connection is most important factor in any relationship. Feeling disconnected or focus going to someone else is indicative of marriage running in deep trouble.</li>\n<li>Finances &#x26; Travel– Sudden long working hours, cash withdrawals to avoid paper statements, increased touring or fuel expenditure may leave lot to ponder about.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A caution here is that we need to understand that we all constantly evolve as a part of our self-growth and many of these behaviours are innocently normal.</p>\n<p>The best is to trust your intuition or your gut feeling and even if it is not about a raunchy affair but it may indicate something else which is real and of concern. One should be patient enough to get to the bottom of it without accusing the partners prematurely.</p>\n<p>In majority of the cases it is the dissatisfaction in the relationship which is a cause of infidelity. Marriage or Couple Counselling helps to uncover these reasons and help to address as well as manage the negative feelings towards each other.</p>"}},"pageContext":{}}}
