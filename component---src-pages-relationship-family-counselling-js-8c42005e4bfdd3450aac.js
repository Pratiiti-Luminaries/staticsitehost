It is usually thought that those who have sought professional help want to change but different couples may come for different reasons. Some people just come as they have been forced while others come as they want to be seen as committed towards relationship. Some have already decided to leave their partners when they come for therapy. Many couples are open to improve their relationship and genuinely willing to benefit from the support in form of relationship counselling.\\n\\nRelationship Counselling is not about who was right or wrong, it is about rebuilding trust and creating healthy boundaries.&^&Few initial sessions in Relationship Counselling are kept to observe the interaction patterns of the couple.&^&Relationship Counselling is more directive and interactive in nature.&^&The goal of Relationship Counselling is to change how the couple views the relationship."},{"id":"3","label":"Why Marriages Fail?","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"The everchanging world is posing new challenges to the married couple. Reducing tolerance levels, rising egos, aspirations, women giving preference to careers rather than family, changing roles of husband and wife, stressful life, lack of communication, changing attitude towards sexuality all these together result in lack of harmony among the married couples. It is now “Me versus We”.\\n\\nThe troubles in Indian marriages are no longer limited to having problems with In-laws or living in joint family. They now are no longer adjustment issues but rather have difficulty living together in the same space with their spouses. An average couple gets married around late twenties, by that time they have had entered into multiple relations, may have lived in with someone and now they expect the spouse to have the best of the qualities from all those they have ever dated. This is so next to impossible. Independent women no longer want to give in or compromise or adjust to their partners. Women are often denied the right to make their own decisions in name of protecting ‘family values’ as India is a patriarchal society where males have power over all family matters, career and property. And now women don’t want to hear ‘NO’.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Emotional Distancing:</strong> When a relationship is heading for disaster you will notice your partner avoiding you, being indifferent, being careless about you and often getting impatient on trivial matters.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Nuclear Family:</strong> The Joint family system is largely unavailable or absent today, the intervention of the elderly ensured the stability of the couple’s marriage. Today even trivial differences are blown out of proportion. With increasing need for asserting independence and diminishing capacity for adjustment marriages are bound to be doomed.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Working Couple:</strong> Inequality in distribution of household chores is also a vital issue. Males still want to have an upper hand although they do help their partners in household chores but the same position changes when they visit their parents or vice versa. We still have very few males like Arjun Kapoor in KI &amp; KA movie. The responsibility towards house and parenting shoulders on the female partner largely. Stressful life, staying in a nuclear family with no support and burn out due to excessive burden at home and work becomes a bone of contention between the couples.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Domestic Violence:</strong> Family instead of being a place of care can also bring conflict, inequality and, far too often, violence. Constant criticism, blaming, accusations, withholding sex, silent treatment, threatening, limiting freedom, ridiculing all are different aspects of emotional abuse. Domestic violence can be physical as well as emotional or verbal. A Family Health Survey revealed that one-third of women above 15 years had suffered domestic violence, with broken bones, teeth and eye injuries.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Societal Pressure:</strong> We still have mind-set of hiding family secrets and believing that dirty linen should not be washed in the public. Couples are often encouraged to stay in an emotionally/physically abusive relationship rather than seek divorce. 90% of Indian marriages are still fixed by families and Marital /Couple counselling is still not a preference even in educated upwardly mobile families. However, off late, a change has been noticed and these societal pressures are gradually fading now.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Mental Health Issues:</strong> Often marriages suffer when the partners are not able to understand underlying mental health problems which are affecting their marriage. Any excessive behaviour, aggression, unfound accusations, excessive mood swings, persistent sadness which is not due to temporary stress reaction to adverse life event may be indicative of mental health issues. On the other hand, stressful relationships with partner can negatively affect the person struggling with mental illness.\\n\\n<strong style=\\"color:black\\">Infidelity:</strong> Indian ethos give paramount importance to sanctity of marriage and abhor Infidelity. However, a landmark ruling by Supreme Court in 2018 said- “Adultery is no longer a criminal offence”. After this ruling a steep surge in dating app users was seen. A latest survey by an Extra-Marital Dating App “Gleeden” reveals that Seven out of ten women in India cheat on their spouses to escape unhappiness, ignorance, neglect in marriage and husbands&#39; non-involvement in household chores. They also may become unfaithful due to monotony in marriage. Insecurity seems to loom large over Indian marriages as per the Hotstar “Out of Love” survey which reveals that 45 per cent of Indians want to check their partner&#39;s phone without their knowledge and 55 per cent have already done. Infidelity is often result of physical, emotional or psychological void that the person tries to fill."},{"id":"4","label":"Challenges of Marital Life","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"In India, marriage is seen as a sacred and quintessential with element of divinity that “Marriages are made in Heaven” and presumption that the bond is everlasting-“Till death do us apart”.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Enhanced Divorce Rates:</strong> Divorce was sought in India in extreme cases of unbearable cruelty, infertility, infidelity or mental illness. India still has the lowest divorce rates in world. While non-marriage is extremely rare in India, the number of divorces has doubled over the past two decades, according to United Nations report &quot;Progress of the World’s Women 2019-2020: Families in a Changing World&quot;.\\n\\n Dating app Truly Madly has witnessed a 200% increase in profiles which openly uphold their status as either divorced, widowed or single parent. Women are no longer helpless pawns, they are independent, have economic autonomy and well educated who can think and take life decisions.\\n\\nDivorce is no more a social taboo or a sign of failure. Divorcees are no longer looked down upon or judged, “there must have been something wrong with this person”. Women from small towns where divorce was unheard of also do not hesitate from walking out of marriage. It is not unusual to see young couples filing for divorce (mostly mutual consent) in their first year of marriage."},{"id":"5","label":"Impact on Children & Family due to Marital Discords","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"Divorce brings in turbulence in the family as it represents the end of marriage. Children often face emotional turmoil when the parents are divorced. Most of such kids feel helpless, confused, angry, sad and guilty. Some kids become anxious and fearful as they think parents would not love them any more as divorce is their fault and blame themselves for it. While others might blame one of the parents or even both. Some red flags to watch for are -decline in academic performance, self-harm, drug abuse, unruly or aggressive behaviour, sleep disturbance, withdrawal from previously enjoyed activities or friends."},{"id":"6","label":"What should be done for Healthy Relationship?","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"My experience as Relationship, Marriage &amp; Couple Counsellor says that healthy relationship can have a healing effect on the individual struggling with mental illness. To strengthen the marriage bond and keep the spark alive between the couple, counselling by experienced psychologist is strongly recommended.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Individual Space:</strong> Its crucial to notice that we need to give space to each other and have alone time within a relationship.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Love &amp; Appreciation:</strong> Small acts and gestures like hugging, kissing and comforting touch go a long way to make couple feel secure and comfortable in their relationship. Appreciating the partner also helps build strong bond. Sharing responsibility and parenting together strengthens the bond.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Space to Grow:</strong> Relationships lose their charm after some time because people feel stuck and unable to progress. By letting go unreasonable expectations and understanding what is important for the other person one can build stronger foundation for marriage.\\n\\n <strong style=\\"color:black\\">Respect for Each Other:</strong> Being mindful about how you communicate with each other is very important. Belittling or invalidating the partner is a strict no-no. Valuing time and opinion of the partner, refraining from treating the partner as a hired helper or cook and protecting the privacy of partner is important. Once the respect is gone it is very difficult to mend the relationship back.\\n\\n You don’t have to wait until your relationship enters into the troubled waters. In my experience, couple often come to seek counselling when they have been unhappy for some time - usually it is 6 years on an average - at this point they are in real crisis. This is often a very hopeless situation where fixing relationship problems becomes very difficult as one partner has almost decided to walk out and the other wants to desperately save the relation.\\n\\nThere are various issues which every married couple face, if you are seeing indicators for trouble marriage, seeking help from experts for Pre or Post Relationship/Couple Counselling is an answer. Some warning signs to watch for:\\n\\nLack of communication&^&Lack of physical/sexual affection&^&Taking you for granted&^&Lack of appreciation&^&Being Disrespectful&^&Constantly blames you&^&Doesn’t give you time&^&Frequent fights&^&Unresolved conflicts&^&Has Affairs&^&Is abusive or threatens you&^&Has severe mood swings&^&Involves in emotional/sexual/physical abuse&^&Doubts you and limits your freedom\\n\\nIn India for those how are looking for comfort and legal help, support groups like “Worthy Women &amp; Divorce”, “Divorce Consult” and “I am Happily Divorced” are now available."},{"id":"7","label":"Benefits of Relationship/ Marital Counselling","transitionComponent":"","headingTag":"","description":"Counselling is highly recommended from expert psychologist for the children to help them adjust and accept their new circumstances after parental divorce.
